### 1. Duplicate Confirmation Email Issue

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity:** High
**Current Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue**

* Confirmation emails were being sent **twice** for each form submission.
* This resulted in users receiving **duplicate emails**, which led to confusion.

**Cause**

* The `handleSubmit` function contained **two identical blocks** invoking `supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation')`.

**Resolution**

```ts
// Removed duplicate invocation of confirmation email function
const { error: emailError } = await supabase.functions.invoke('send-confirmation', {
  body: {
    name: formData.name,
    email: formData.email,
    industry: formData.industry,
  },
});
```

**Outcome**
✅ Email now sent only once per submission
✅ Cleaner user experience
✅ Reduced redundant function calls and cost

---

### 2. Lead Data Not Saving to DB

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity:** Critical
**Current Status:** ✅ Resolved

**Issue**

* Although the UI showed success, **lead information was not saved** to the database.
* There was no backend validation or error catching.

**Cause**

* Missing Supabase `.insert()` logic
* No check for duplicate email addresses or error state

**Resolution**

```ts
// Check for existing lead
const { data: existingLead, error: checkError } = await supabase
  .from('leads')
  .select('email')
  .eq('email', formData.email)
  .single();

// Insert lead if not already present
const { error: insertError } = await supabase
  .from('leads')
  .insert({
    name: formData.name,
    email: formData.email,
    industry: formData.industry,
  });
```

**Outcome**
✅ New leads stored correctly
✅ Duplicate email logic added
✅ Improved error handling throughout

---

### 3. Toast Notifications for Submission Feedback

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity:** Medium
**Current Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Enhancement**

* Introduced toast messages for clear **user feedback** after submission attempts.

**Added Toasts**

```ts
// On success
toast({ title: "Success", description: "Thank you! Your details were submitted." });

// Duplicate entry
toast({ title: "Already Exists", description: "A lead with this email already exists.", variant: "destructive" });

// On DB error
toast({ title: "Error", description: "Unable to save your information.", variant: "destructive" });

// On any unexpected failure
toast({ title: "Oops!", description: "Something went wrong. Please try again later.", variant: "destructive" });
```

**Outcome**
✅ Users receive immediate, meaningful feedback
✅ Better error visibility
✅ More intuitive user experience

---

### 4. Submission Button Loading State

**File:** `src/components/LeadCaptureForm.tsx`
**Severity:** Low (UI/UX)
**Current Status:** ✅ Implemented

**Issue**

* No indication that submission was in progress
* Users could click the submit button **multiple times**, potentially resending requests

**Resolution**

```tsx
// Manage loading state
const [isSubmitting, setIsSubmitting] = useState(false);

// Update button content dynamically
disabled={isSubmitting}
{isSubmitting ? (
  <>
    <Loader2 className="w-5 h-5 mr-2 animate-spin" />
    Submitting...
  </>
) : (
  <>
    <CheckCircle className="w-5 h-5 mr-2" />
    Get Early Access
  </>
)}
```

**Outcome**
✅ Prevents rapid resubmission
✅ Loading spinner provides visual feedback
✅ More polished and responsive interface
